# 🔍 Comparative Analysis of Vision Transformer (ViT) and Swin Transformer

## 📌 Overview

This project presents a comprehensive comparative study of two state-of-the-art vision architectures — **Vision Transformer (ViT)** and **Swin Transformer** — across multiple computer vision tasks. The goal is to evaluate and analyze their performance in terms of accuracy, efficiency, scalability, and suitability for real-world applications.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Evaluate ViT and Swin Transformer on **Image Classification**, **Object Detection**, and **Semantic Segmentation** tasks.
- Measure performance using standard datasets: `CIFAR-100`, `COCO`, and `ADE20K`.
- Compare architectural differences, attention mechanisms, and hierarchical design.
- Draw practical conclusions about trade-offs in speed, performance, and deployment.
